## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

You can run this project in two ways. The GUI is recommended for the best experience.

### GUI Application (Recommended)

This method requires two separate terminals running simultaneously.

1.  **Start the Automated Watcher (Terminal 1):**
    This script monitors your `screenshots` folder and automatically indexes new images. Keep it running in the background.

    ```bash
    python watcher.py
    ```

2.  **Launch the GUI (Terminal 2):**
    This will start the Streamlit web server and open the application in your browser.
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

For scripting or terminal-based workflows, use the unified CLI.

- **Index a Folder (One-Time Scan):**

  ```bash
  python vms/main.py index --path /path/to/screenshots
  ```

- **Search from the Terminal:**

  ```bash
  python vms/main.py search "a python function with a for loop"
  ```

- **Watch a Folder (CLI version):**
  ```bash
  python vms/main.py watch
  ```
